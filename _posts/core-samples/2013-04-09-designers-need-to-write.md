Designers need to write more. I will be starting here with interesting thoughts around UX and strategy as I see it, things that I have found to be successul and lessons I have learned.

Really when it comes to creativity you need to have a passion. Find whatever makes you happy and do it on the nights and weekends. For a long time that is what I was doing. Only nights and weekends until I came to NPR. It allowed me the ability to learn and investigate the user much more than in past positions as a Designer. 

More to come...
